## 1.1.1
- Fixed an issue with this mod that was preventing some players from seeing interact prompts with anything (unless holding shift to sprint)

## 1.1.0
- Fixed mod after it broke. It now uses ffmpeg to merge the downloaded audio/video streams
- /tvolume command should now be client-sided, preventing audio trolling
- Config file ("YTTV.cfg") can now be accessed from the R2Modman Config editor, instead of having to open file explorer and find the file...
    - Sorry if you were using something other than English, the mod's going to default to using English with this new version, and you have to change it in the new config

## 1.0.5
- Fixed the mod after it stopped working for everyone. Sorry it took me so long (again)...
    - The GitHub shows the specific fix I implemented

## 1.0.4
- Updated to use yt-dlp 2025.10.14. Sorry it took me so long, I've been very busy...

## 1.0.3
- Updated to use yt-dlp 2025.08.20. Last version broke right after I uploaded it because the old yt-dlp version no longer works...

## 1.0.2
- Updated to use latest version of yt-dlp; fixed mod so that it ACTUALLY updates yt-dlp.exe

## 1.0.1
- Made videos reset to start <em>when the TV powers off</em> by default; makes it easy to just turn the TV on and off again to fix desync between players

## 1.0.0
- Initial mod release
